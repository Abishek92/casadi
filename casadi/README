This is a computer algebra system and automatic-differentiation tool. The user builds up the functions by vector and matrix operations. The syntax trees (both of the functions themselves and of their derivatives) can then be sorted in the order of evaluation (i.e. the algorithm). When the function eventually needs to be evaluated, this can be done very efficiently.

The function has three main classes:

Scalar expression, or "SX", is a symbolic equivalent to the double numeric type. Functions that act on the class share the syntax with standard math.h functions
Matrix expression, or "MX", allows the user to build up complex programs at runtime, which can be executed efficiently. The syntax is matrix algebra
Function expression, or "FX", allows the user to create functions dynamically (i.e. at runtime)

The package has no dependencies other than the standard template library.
