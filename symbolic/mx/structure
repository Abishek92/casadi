Classes in the MX class
MX: expression class

MXNode: Abstract base class to all nodes

Derived classes
Already done
- SymbolicMXNode: like now
- MXConstant: like now
- Norm (inf-norm,2-norm,1-norm): like now
- ScalarMatrixOp: a*B, a/B, pow(a,B) etc.
- MatrixScalarOp: A*b, A/b, pow(A,b) etc.
- Evaluation: like now
- Multiplication: like now

- Index:     "A(I)". Get element by their index, index starts with 1! Uses binsorting to sort indices in linear time.
- UnaryOp: (elementwise) unary operation
- MatrixMatrixOp: (elementwise) binary operation
- HorizCat: horizontal concatenation: {A,B,C} 
- VertCat: vertical concatenation: {{A},{B},{C}}

To remove:
- Transpose (replaced by index+function)
- Addition,Subtraction (replaced by BinaryOp)
- ScalarMultiplication (replaced by MatrixScalarOp, ScalarMatrixOp)
- ScalarDivision (replaced by MatrixScalarOp)
- MatrixElement (replaced by Index)
- BlockMatrix (replaced by HorizCat,VertCat)


Not needed
- Submatrix: "A(I1,I2)" I1 and I2 vectors. Uses binsorting to sort indices in linear time.
