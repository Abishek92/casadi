Sundials bugs:

*CVodes fails to pass the user data structure at the first call for the adjoint problem (passes a null pointer instead)
- workaround with static pointer possible (but ugly and not thread-safe)

*Segfault in CVodes when using finite differences to calculate forward sensitivities
- serious, no good workaround
- needs more testing

*Segfault in CVodes when trying to integrate outside the time interval where the forward problem (with taping) was _first_ solved
- serious
- needs to check if IDAS behaves the same way
