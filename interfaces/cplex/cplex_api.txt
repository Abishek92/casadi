The description of the CPLEX function CPXcopylp and CPXcopyquad has been taken from the CPLEX documentation (version 12.2)

status = CPXcopylp(CPXCENVptr env, CPXLPptr lp, int numcols, int numrows, int objsense, const double * objective, const double * rhs, const char * sense,
                   const int * matbeg, const int * matcnt, const int * matind, const double * matval, const double * lb, const double * ub, const double * rngval)
  The routine CPXcopylp copies data that define an LP problem to a CPLEX problem object. The arguments to CPXcopylp define an objective function,
  the constraint matrix, the righthand side, and the bounds on the variables. Calling CPXcopylp destroys any existing data associated with the problem object.
  The routine CPXcopylp does not copy names. The more comprehensive routine CPXcopylpwnames can be used in place of CPXcopylp to copy linear programs with
  associated names.
  The arguments passed to CPXcopylp define a linear program. Since these arguments are copied into local arrays maintained by CPLEX, the LP problem data
  passed via CPXcopylp may be modified or freed after the call to CPXcopylp without affecting the state of the CPLEX problem object.
 
  Arguments:
    env: A pointer to the CPLEX environment as returned by CPXopenCPLEX.
    lp: A pointer to a CPLEX problem object as returned by CPXcreateprob.
    numcols: An integer that specifies the number of columns in the constraint matrix, or equivalently, the number of variables in the problem object.
    numrows: An integer that specifies the number of rows in the constraint matrix, not including the objective function or bounds on the variables.
    objsen: An integer that specifies whether the problem is a minimization or maximization problem.
      objsen  = 1 : (CPX_MIN) minimize
      objsen = -1 : (CPX_MAX) maximize
    objective: An array of length at least numcols containing the objective function coefficients.
    rhs: An array of length at least numrows containing the righthand side value for each constraint in the constraint matrix.
    sense: An array of length at least numrows containing the sense of each constraint in the constraint matrix.
      sense[i] = 'L' : <= constraint
      sense[i] = 'E' : = constraint
      sense[i] = 'G' : >= constraint
      sense[i] = 'R' : ranged constrain
    matbeg: An array that with matval, matcnt, and matind defines the constraint matrix.
    matcnt: An array that with matbeg, matval, and matind defines the constraint matrix.
    matind: An array that with matbeg, matcnt, and matval defines the constraint matrix.
    matval: An array that with matbeg, matcnt, and matind defines the constraint matrix. CPLEX needs to know only the nonzero coefficients.
            These are grouped by column in the array matval. The nonzero elements of every column must be stored in sequential locations in
            this array with matbeg[j] containing the index of the beginning of column j and matcnt[j] containing the number of entries in column j.
            The components of matbeg must be in ascending order. For each k, matind[k] specifies the row number of the corresponding coefficient, matval[k].
    lb: An array of length at least numcols containing the lower bound on each of the variables. Any lower bound that is set to a value less than
        or equal to that of the constant -CPX_INFBOUND is treated as negative infinity. CPX_INFBOUND is defined in the header file cplex.h.
    ub: An array of length at least numcols containing the upper bound on each of the variables. Any upper bound that is set to a value greater than
        or equal to that of the constant CPX_INFBOUND is treated as infinity. CPX_INFBOUND is defined in the header file cplex.h.
    rngval: An array of length at least numrows containing the range value of each ranged constraint. Ranged rows are those designated by 'R' in the sense array.
            If the row is not ranged, the rngval array entry is ignored. If rngval[i] > 0, then row i activity is in [rhs[i],rhs[i]+rngval[i]], and if
            rngval[i] <= 0,then row i activity is in [rhs[i]+rngval[i],rhs[i]]. This argument may be NULL.

status = CPXcopyquad(CPXCENVptr env, CPXLPptr lp, const int * qmatbeg, const int * qmatcnt, const int * qmatind, const double * qmatval)
  The routine CPXcopyquad is used to copy a quadratic objective matrix Q when Q is not diagonal. The arguments qmatbeg, qmatcnt, qmatind, and qmatval
  are used to specify the nonzero coefficients of the matrix Q. The meaning of these vectors is identical to the meaning of the corresponding vectors
  matbeg, matcnt, matind and matval, which are used to specify the structure of A in a call to CPXcopylp.
  Q must be symmetric when copied by this function. Therefore, if the quadratic coefficient in algebraic form is 2x1x2, then x2 should be in the list
  for x1, and x1 should be in the list for x2, and the coefficient would be 1.0 in each of those entries. See the corresponding example C program to
  review how the symmetry requirement is implemented.
  
  Arguments:
    env: A pointer to the CPLEX environment as returned by CPXopenCPLEX.
    lp: A pointer to a CPLEX problem object as returned by CPXcreateprob.
    qmatbeg: An array that with qmatcnt, qmatind, and qmatval defines the quadratic coefficient matrix.
    qmatcnt: An array that with qmatbeg, qmatind, and qmatval defines the quadratic coefficient matrix.
    qmatind: An array that with qmatbeg, qmatcnt, and qmatval defines the quadratic coefficient matrix.
    qmatval: An array that with qmatbeg, qmatcnt, and qmatind defines the quadratic coefficient matrix. The arrays qmatbeg and qmatcnt should be of length
            at least CPXgetnumcols(env,lp). The arrays qmatind and qmatval should be of length at least qmatbeg[numcols-1]+qmatcnt[numcols-1]. CPLEX requires
            only the nonzero coefficients grouped by column in the array qmatval. The nonzero elements of every column must be stored in sequential locations
            in this array with qmatbeg[j] containing the index of the beginning of column j and qmatcnt[j] containing the number of entries in column j. Note
            that the components of qmatbeg must be in ascending order. For each k, qmatind[k] indicates the column number of the corresponding coefficient,
            qmatval[k]. These arrays are accessed as explained above.

status = CPXaddqconstr(CPXCENVptr env, CPXLPptr lp, int linnzcnt, int quadnzcnt, double rhs, int sense, const int * linind, const double * linval, const int * quadrow,
                        const int * quadcol, const double * quadval, const char * lname_str)
  The routine CPXaddqconstr adds a quadratic constraint to a specified CPLEX problem object. This routine may be called any time after a call to CPXcreateprob.
  
  Arguments:
    env: A pointer to the CPLEX environment as returned by CPXopenCPLEX.
    lp: A pointer to a CPLEX problem object as returned by CPXcreateprob.
    linnzcnt: An integer that indicates the number of nonzero constraint coefficients in the linear part of the constraint.
              This specifies the length of the arrays linind and linval.
    quadnzcnt: An integer that indicates the number of nonzero constraint coefficients in the quadratic part of the constraint. This specifies the length of
              the arrays quadrow, quadcol and quadval.
    rhs: The righthand side term for the constraint to be added.
    sense: The sense of the constraint to be added. Note that quadratic constraints may only be less-than-or-equal-to or greater-than-or-equal-to constraints.
          See the discussion of QCP in the CPLEX User's Manual.
    linind: An array that with linval defines the linear part of the quadratic constraint to be added.
    linval: An array that with linind defines the linear part of the constraint to be added. The nonzero coefficients of the linear terms must be stored in sequential
          locations in the arrays linind and linval from positions 0 to linnzcnt-1. Each entry, linind[i], indicates the variable index of the corresponding coefficient,
          linval[i]. May be NULL; then the constraint will have no linear terms.
    quadrow: An array that with quadcol and quadval defines the quadratic part of the quadratic constraint to be added.
    quadcol: An array that with quadrow and quadval defines the quadratic part of the quadratic constraint to be added.
    quadval: An array that with quadrow and quadcol define the quadratic part of the constraint to be added. The nonzero coefficients of the quadratic terms
          must be stored in sequential locations in the arrays quadrow, quadcol and quadval from positions 0 to quadnzcnt-1. Each pair, quadrow[i], quadcol[i], indicates
          the variable indices of the quadratic term, and quadval[i] the corresponding coefficient.
    lname_str: The name of the constraint to be added. May be NULL, in which case the new constraint is assigned a default name if the quadratic constraints already
          resident in the CPLEX problem object have names; otherwise, no name is associated with the constraint.
